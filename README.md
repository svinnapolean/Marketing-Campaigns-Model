## 📊 ML Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict customer responses to marketing campaigns using a cleaned dataset. It demonstrates end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

### 📁 Project Structure

- `ML_Marketing_Compaign.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all steps from data loading to model evaluation.
- `cleaned_marketing_data.csv`: Preprocessed dataset used for training and testing.

---

### 🧠 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics and distribution insights.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Standardization of numeric features
  - One-hot encoding of categorical features
  - ColumnTransformer for unified preprocessing
- **Modeling**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy scores via 5-fold cross-validation
  - Comparison of model performance
